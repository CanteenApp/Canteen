          My friends and I just returned from a 2-day trip summiting Half Dome in Yosemite National Park.  Thanks to Canteen, we were able to easily organize the planning of our trip and collaborate on the gear and food needed. Thank's Canteen! <br /> - Ted Bontaum, Berkeley CA

          Every year, my family takes a 1 week outdoor adventure, and this year we decided to road trip through the old Mohave Trail. Usually, I do all the planning and organizing of the gear and food needed alone.  This time we used Canteen, and boy was it a huge help!  We planned the whole trip together as a family, without forgetting anything! <br /> - Beth Livingston, Red Hook NY
